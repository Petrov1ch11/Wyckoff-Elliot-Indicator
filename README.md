It attempts to identify high and low points on the chart, which are components of Elliott Waves. A bullish signal is identified if the current closing price is higher than the previous close and today's volume is greater than yesterday's. A bearish signal is identified if the current closing price is lower than the previous close and today's volume is greater than yesterday's..

This script has the potential to help generate profits, but its effectiveness will depend on various factors. The ability to interpret and react to the signals generated by the script is crucial. This script is a useful tool that can help identify trading opportunities, but it is not a guarantee of profit. It is important to use it as part of a well-planned trading strategy and always practice good risk management. Test it extensively on a demo account before applying it to a real account, and be prepared to adjust and adapt as necessary.

The script can be a useful tool for identifying buying and selling signals, potentially aiding in making more informed entries and exits. However, even with good indicators, leverage should be used with extreme caution and within a well-managed trading strategy.
